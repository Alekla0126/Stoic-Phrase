# Stoic Phrase

**Stoic Phrase** is a lightweight bash script that fetches a stoic quote from an online API and displays it in vibrant, colorful text using [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat). It’s a fun and inspirational way to receive daily stoic wisdom right in your terminal!

## Features

- **Fetches a Stoic Quote:** Uses [Stoic Quotes API](https://stoic-quotes.com/api/quote) to get a random quote.
- **Colorful Output:** Pipes the quote through `lolcat` for a rainbow-colored display.
- **Lightweight & Portable:** A simple bash script that works on any Unix-like system.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (usually pre-installed)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) – for parsing JSON data
- [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) – for colorful terminal output

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. **Download the Script:**

   Clone the repository or download the `stoic-phrase.sh` file.

2. **Make It Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x stoic-phrase.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   ./stoic-phrase.sh
   ```

### Installation via Homebrew Tap

You can also install **Stoic Phrase** using Homebrew by tapping into a custom repository.

1. **Tap the Repository:**

   ```bash
   brew tap yourusername/stoic-phrase
   ```

2. **Install the Script:**

   ```bash
   brew install stoic-phrase
   ```

3. **Run the Command:**

   Once installed, simply run:

   ```bash
   stoic-phrase
   ```

## Usage

Run the command (either the script directly or via Homebrew) to fetch and display a new stoic quote in colorful text:

```bash
stoic-phrase
```

Each execution fetches a new quote from the API and pipes it through `lolcat` for an eye-catching display.

## Publishing a New Release
